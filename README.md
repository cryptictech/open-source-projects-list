# Open Source Projects List
This repo is a compilation of several lists of open source projects that facinate me broken down by category. These lists are meant to be as comprehensive as possible, but may take a while to get there. A lot of projects fall into several categories, so don't be surprised by duplicates. These projects are not necessarily hosted on Github, but quite a few are.

### Main Categories
- [AI Technology](ai_tech.md)
- [Self hosted web apps](self_hosted.md)
- [Desktop applications](desktop_apps.md)
- [Mobile applications](mobile_apps.md)
- [Embedded or IoT applications](embedded_apps.md)
- [Server applications](server_apps.md)
- [Video games](video_games.md)
- [Hardware](hardware.md)
- [Frameworks](frameworks.md)
- [Development libraries](libraries.md)

### Other Great Lists
There are many great lists out there. Relevant lists are linked within each category, or you can check out my list of lists (to be built, link repo). I encourage you to check them out as well.

### Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to these lists, there's several ways you can help out:

1. Submit an issue if you see an issue or wish to suggest an addition without submitting a pull request.
2. Submit a pull request if you'd like to add a project to a list.
3. See sponsors if you'd like to contribute financially.
